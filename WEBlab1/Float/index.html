            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
            It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
            and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
            language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation 
            can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity 
            and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the 
            pages that share the file and its formatting.
